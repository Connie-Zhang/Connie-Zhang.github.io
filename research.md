### MIA Internship
* Analyzed visitor survey data and created an [interactive shiny app](https://cornerz.shinyapps.io/MIA_Seasonality/) to help inform the museum’s reopening decisions after its closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Researched and performed natural language processing algorithms to create tags for every art object at MIA that will be used by the curatorial departments in the future.


### Independent Project
* Clean messy data and extract useful information from complex, large datasets using R.
* Analyzed exhibition patterns over time and how the exhibited artworks at Minneapolis Institute of Art are selected and their diversity.
* Expanded the project to include data from MIA’s private database.
