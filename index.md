I am an undergraduate statistics student at Macalester College, advised by [Dr. Brianna Heggeseth](https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth). I am interested in pursuing a Biostatistics PhD. I have done research on the Minneapolis Insitute of Art's data, cleaning large messy data. I also worked there as a summer intern. I developed a R Shiny app that reflects the museum's visitor seasonality and applied natural language processing algorithms to identify themes of their artworks.
