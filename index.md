<img align="left" width="250" src="assets/my_image.jpg"> I am an undergraduate statistics student at Macalester College, advised by [Dr. Brianna Heggeseth](https://sites.google.com/macalester.edu/bcheggeseth). I am interested in pursuing a Biostatistics PhD. I have done research on the Minneapolis Insitute of Art's data, cleaning large messy data. I also worked there as a summer intern. I developed a R Shiny app that reflects the museum's visitor seasonality and applied natural language processing algorithms to identify themes of their artworks.

Outside of statistics, you can find me reading, making food, and hanging out with my dog!
