![image](/assets/my_image.jpg){: width="250px" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" } I am an undergraduate statistics student at Macalester College, advised by [Dr. Brianna Heggeseth](https://bcheggeseth.github.io). I am interested in pursuing a Phd in 
Biostatistics or Statistics. 

Recently, I have been working with Prof. Heggeseth to analyze high rates of acute
kidney failure in Mesoamerica among young adult men, using growth mixture models
and hidden markov models. We are collaborating with statisticians and doctors in 
UK and Nicaragua. 

I am also working with [Dr. Hossein Khiabanian](http://www.khiabanian-lab.org) at 
Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey. I worked on applying the Tunable Biclustering 
Algorithm (TuBA) to examine genetic and clinical data of cancer patients. I 
explored how gene expression, copy number amplification and deletion, and 
chromosome locus position are related to cancer prognosis. I am working on writing
a manuscript for an interactive shiny app that presents the results of TuBA and 
my analysis for 23 cancer types.

My first research project is to work with museum data from the Minneapolis Institute
of Art. I analyzed exhibition patterns and diversity of the artworks. During the 
start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I also analyzed visitor survey data to help inform
the museum's reopening decisions.

Outside of statistics, you can find me reading, making food, and hanging out with my dog!
