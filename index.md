![image](/assets/my_image.jpg){: width="250px" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" } I am an undergraduate statistics student at Macalester College, advised by [Dr. Brianna Heggeseth](https://bcheggeseth.github.io). I am interested in pursuing a Phd in 
Biostatistics or Statistics. I have researched with Minneapolis Insistute of Art, 
[Dr. Hossein Khiabanian](http://www.khiabanian-lab.org) at Rutgers Cancer 
Institute of New Jersey, and Prof. Heggeseth collaborating with statisticians and
 doctors in UK and Nicaragua.

Outside of statistics, you can find me reading, making food, and hanging out with my dog!
